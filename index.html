          "It's such a great piece of history. The grounds are well kept and preserved. The house was amazing, allowing you to imagine what life was. The gardens are filled with beautiful flowers and trees. The conservatory is unreal, with the size of some of the plants and rarity of some of the orchids. The winery tasting was nice after all the walking. There's also quite a few eating places between the winery and the house. Plan for a full day to see it all."" <br>-	Randall Daughtry</p>
